# Leader-Follower-Formation-Control
 This repository implements a Lyapunov-based leader–follower strategy for nonholonomic, differential-drive wheeled robots. A single “leader” vehicle generates a desired trajectory, while multiple “followers” autonomously track its motion, maintaining prescribed inter-vehicle distances—and, in the full control law, orientations as well. Three Python simulation scripts demonstrate the method under progressively challenging scenarios:  Line Formation (velocity control only)  Rectangular Formation (velocity control only)  Complex Trajectory (distance + orientation control)  Each script models the robots’ nonholonomic kinematics, applies a rigorously derived Lyapunov control law, and visualizes the resulting formations. Whether you’re exploring multi-agent coordination or developing advanced formation controllers, this codebase offers a clear, extensible foundation.

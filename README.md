# Leader-Follower-Formation-Control
 This repository implements a Lyapunov-based leader‚Äìfollower strategy for nonholonomic, differential-drive wheeled robots. A single ‚Äúleader‚Äù vehicle generates a desired trajectory, while multiple ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù autonomously track its motion, maintaining prescribed inter-vehicle distances‚Äîand, in the full control law, orientations as well. Three Python simulation scripts demonstrate the method under progressively challenging scenarios:  Line Formation (velocity control only)  Rectangular Formation (velocity control only)  Complex Trajectory (distance + orientation control)  Each script models the robots‚Äô nonholonomic kinematics, applies a rigorously derived Lyapunov control law, and visualizes the resulting formations. Whether you‚Äôre exploring multi-agent coordination or developing advanced formation controllers, this codebase offers a clear, extensible foundation.

## üîç Overview

This project implements a **leader‚Äìfollower** formation control strategy for differential-drive robots based on Lyapunov stability theory.  
- **Leader** generates the desired trajectory.  
- **Followers** track the leader while maintaining specified distances (and orientations, in the full control law).  

Three simulation scripts demonstrate the approach under increasing complexity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Nonholonomic Kinematics** model of a differential-drive robot  
- **Lyapunov-based** control laws for:  
  - Pure position tracking (distance only)  
  - Full pose tracking (distance + orientation)  
- **Three scenarios**:  
  1. Line formation (velocity control only)  
  2. Rectangular formation (velocity control only)  
  3. Complex trajectory (complete control law)
